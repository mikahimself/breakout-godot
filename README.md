# Breakout-ish

This project is a simple Breakout clone created with Godot Engine 3.1. It was created for the sole purpose of learning how to create things with Godot Engine.

The game contains four glorious colors and five levels worth of challenge, so it should provide you with at least ten minutes worth of entertainment.

Feel free to copy bits and pieces of the code into your own project, if you feel like it. If you choose to do so, it would be nice of you to let me know you did. But feel free to copy without letting me know, if that's your thing.
